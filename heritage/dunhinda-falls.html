          known as the Bridal Falls as it flows down in the shape of a veil of a

          Dunhinda Falls is another picturesque waterfall that is located 5km
          off the Badulla Town. The name Dunhinda was given to the waterfall due
          to the mist that is created by the water stream that flows downwards
          from the falls. The height of the Dunhinda Falls is around 210 feet.
          And it is also known as the Bridal Falls as it flows down in the shape
          of a veil of a Bride. The waterfall flows and joins the Badulu Oya
          which flows through the Badulla town. There will be a fee for both the
          locals and the tourist to visit the Dunhinda Falls. If you are
          starting your journey from Colombo then the best thing that you can do
          is to book the Badulla Colombo Night mail train starting from Colombo
          Fort Station at 8.15 pm. Then throughout the night, the train will
          slowly rumble to a halt in Badulla around 6.30 am in the morning. You
          might experience freezing weather conditions. So, donâ€™t forget to sip
          a hot coffee from a seller on the train. At 6.30 in the morning you
          might not find a bus, therefore its better you know how much time it
          will take you to travel to Dunhinda from Badulla town. If you plan to
          walk from Badulla to Dunhinda falls you can use Mahiyangana Road which
          will take you 45 mins to reach Dunhinda. By means of a vehicle, it
          will take around 15 mins to reach Dunhinda. Else if you plan to hire a
          bicycle then it will take around 20-30 minutes to reach the Dunhinda
          falls.
