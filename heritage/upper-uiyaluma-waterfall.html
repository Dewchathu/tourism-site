          Upper Diyaluma is somewhere you can have trekked down through a
          ten-minute short hike to the hill from the Diyaluma falls. The
          stunning view of mountains and lush greens would make you spellbound
          for a few seconds. The series of the water pools flows together and
          prolapse from the edge into another large pool before collapsing
          through the precipice. The enchanting massive pool is located 628 feet
          down from the edge of the last pool creating the amazing Diyaluma
          waterfall. Itâ€™s hard to have a look down from the crest. But, if you
          are brave, there is a chance of peer over the cliff and look over the
          giant waterfalls down.
