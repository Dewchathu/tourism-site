          It is the second-highest waterfall in Sri Lanka which is 220m (720
          feet) high located near Koslanda. If you reach the top of the Diyaluma
          falls (Upper Diyaluma) then you will be able to go for a swim in the
          natural pools. Keep an eye on the rising water levels during the rainy
          season in this area.

          Yes, you are right you came here to read about the second-highest
          waterfall in the island of Sri Lanka. Diyaluma is one of the best
          iconic waterfalls in the country which is located in Koslanda that
          belongs to the Badulla District. The meaning of Diyaluma stands for
          the rapid flow of water downstream. The waterfall is 220m (720 feet)
          high and it laster turned in to Punagala Oya which is a branch of the
          Kuda Oya that then joins the Kirinndi Oya. If you are planning to
          start your journey from Colombo then the best thing you can do is to
          Jump on the Badulla Night Mail Train which will start at 8.15 PM from
          Colombo and the Trail will reach Haputale by 6.30 am in the morning.
          There are plenty of Coffee sellers for you to warm you up in the cold
          weather conditions on your journey to Haputale. So, the journey begins
          from Haputale on a bus to Wellawaya and you will have to get down at
          Koslanda Junction. Next, hire a tuk-tuk to the Diyaluma falls. Or you
          can simply hire a rent a car for the whole journey. The best part is
          that you can ask the tuk-tuk drivers to take you to watch the
          elephants who come to drink water from the upper deck of the Diyaluma
          falls. Tuk-tuk drivers will drop you at the Poonagala estate where you
          will have to go through a trek. The estate is famous for its rubber
          and the breath-taking view is one of a kind. And you will surely enjoy
          the journey to the falls even though you find some rocky places on the
          way. Once you continue the journey for about 45 minutes you will reach
          the Upper Diyaluma. You can find some natural water basins on top of
          the Upper Deck of Diyaluma falls but keep an eye on the rising water
          levels during the rainy season.
