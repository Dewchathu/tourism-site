          It is another iconic waterfall in Badulla which is 82 feet in height.
          It is one of the best 3 tire waterfalls in Sri Lanka. We would not
          recommend you to hike up the rocky waterfall but why not have a dip in
          the basin right below the Ravana Falls. Among the most Iconic places
          in the Badulla District Ravana falls is another place where you could
          enjoy the natural beauty in Sri Lanka. It’s not far away if you are
          planning to Visit Ella Rock or the Little Adams Peak. So, without
          wasting your time just jump on a bus or a Tuk Tuk and get directions
          to the Ravana falls.

          It’s a 10 mins ride to reach this beautiful place in Ella. The
          waterfall flows in between the littles Adams Peak and the Ella Rock.
          The height of the water wall is around 82 feet which cascade down over
          an oval-shaped rock. The Ravana Waterfall was named in memory of King
          Ravana who was once the most technologically advanced king based on
          historical Information. King Ravana hid Princess Sita in the Ravana
          Caves right Behind the Waterfall. This is based on prehistoric
          information and the Ramayana Story. It is believed that Princess Sita
          bathed in the Ravana Waterfall which was covered with thick dense
          forest back in the days. Even though there are no warning signs you
          should not climb over the slippery surfaces. Yes, you can go for a dip
          in the basin right below the Ravana Falls. However, it might be
          dangerous to climb over the rocks. If you visit during a rainy season
          then you can easily see the waterfall flow in the shape of an Areca
          flower. But during the dry season the water flow will reduce
          dramatically. This place is said to be one of the best for nature
          photography. Plus, you can find enough locals around the place if you
          are interested in knowing a bit more about the surroundings. The water
          in the Ravana Falls is crystal clear and they come from natural
          springs. Locals and Tourists are strictly advised not to litter the
          place if they visit the Ravana Falls.
