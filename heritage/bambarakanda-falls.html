          Bambarakanda Falls is the tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka which flows
          through the mountain range of Kalupahana. The height of the waterfall
          is approximately 863 feet situated in the Badulla District. It is the
          299th world tallest waterfall. Bambarakanda Falls is a branch of Kuda
          Oya which later joins the Walawe River. There are many ways that you
          can use to reach the Bambarakanda waterfall. The best way is to take
          the Balangoda to Badulla Route. This is also known as the A4 Highway
          that leads to Kalupahana Junction. Then follow the signboards along
          the road for at least 3.5 km or you can try out with a vehicle that
          has good ground clearance. The road to Bambarakanda Falls is quite
          narrow and the road has not been renovated. Therefore, the best way is
          to travel by foot. Bambarakanda Falls is one of the best places for
          photography and hikers. There is a trail that will lead to the upper
          deck of the waterfall. There is a large basin on the top of the fall,
          which is connected with the waterfall. Even though it looks safe there
          might be a sudden rise in the water level. Therefore, the tourist and
          the locals are to keep an eye on the rising water levels. The best
          months to visit the beautiful waterfall is from March to May when the
          water levels are low. And it is very dangerous to go near the
          waterfall between the months of November and February with the heavy
          rainfall in the hill country. If you are planning to hike up the
          waterfall, then make sure that you gear up for the journey. There are
          leaches in this area which are blood-sucking insects but harmless.
          With a bit of lime-based solution or concentrated salt solution, you
          will be able to easily get rid of them.
