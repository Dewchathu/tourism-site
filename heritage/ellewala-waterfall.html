        <p>
          Ellewala waterfall is a beatific small waterfall popular for its
          eco-liveliness and peaceful-countryside atmosphere hidden inside the
          territory of the Ella jungle. It’s not exactly similar to Ella falls,
          but, many people still manage to visit Ellewala falls to enjoy a bath,
          diving, or splash time in a natural pool in the midst of the jungle.
          It is also called chasing waterfall.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s about 4 meters’ height waterfall that is are accessible from Ella
          – Wellawaya road, at least five kilometers inside woods from Wellawaya
          town. When you are coming from Wellawaya, 3 km along the Ella road to
          reach an ancient temple, Rathmal Vehera. The opposite road from the
          temple directly leads to the falls. If you are expecting to stay a
          couple of days in Ella, Ellewala falls an awesome place you should
          never miss. Except on the rainy days, it’s a well enjoyable, safe
          natural pool you can have some relaxation in your busy schedule. It’s
          a precaution because on rainy days the water level in Ellewala falls
          can be dramatically increased. And finding help at a center of a
          jungle would not be that easy. There is an awesome cyclic trek, one of
          the most adventurous cycling trek in Sri Lanka. it’s almost spattered
          downhill and you have to ride uphill by a vehicle. Amongst the ride,
          it gives rider lifetime memories of Sri Lankan villages, paddy fields,
          waterways, and epic views of amazing landscapes.
