          Once the great tea planter Sir Thomas Lipton used to sit and observe
          his pride from the Lipton Seat. You can easily observe the Dambatenna
          tea estate and as far as Hambantota Harbor in the Southern Coastal
          belt from Lipton Seat. Try to visit the point of observation in the
          morning to get the best view.

          It is one of the best-elevated viewpoints in Sri Lanka situated along
          the Haputale road in the Badulla District. Lipton Seat is in the
          Dambatenna tea factory. You will be able to observe a breath-taking
          view from the Lipton’s Seat where once the great tea planter Sir
          Thomas Lipton used to observe his plantation. It’s a journey of around
          7 km through the beautiful tea estate of Dambatenna to reach Lipton
          Seat or you can come through Nayabedda estate in Bandarawela. There
          are plenty of signs which will help you to reach the point of the
          Lipton Seat. In some parts of the route you will be able to observe
          the original paving stones that were used during the British time
          period to construct the road. The journey to the place will be roughly
          around 2 to 3 hours but it will not be a tiring journey to reach the
          point of observation. Once you reach the famous Lipton Seat then you
          will be able to view Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Central and Eastern provinces
          where you can easily view them from the point of observation. In
          addition to that Udawalawe Lake, Chandrika Lake and the Handapangala
          Lake can be observed on a clear day when there is no mist surrounding
          the mountain ranges. Moreover, you will be able to observe the
          Hambantota Harbor in the southern coastal belt. If you are visiting
          Lipton Seat from the Nayabedda Estate then you will be able to witness
          the Bandarawela City from Catherine’s Seat. Lemathota waterfall is
          also another wonderful site for the visitors if you select the
          Dambatenna route to Visit Lipton Seat. The route from Dambatenna is
          not quite famous but it will be a great opportunity for you to
          experience the rich biodiversity with a variety of fauna and flora.
