          It is one of the best British Colonial Houses that is well preserved
          up to date, situated near Haputhale in the Badulla District. The
          history of the Adisham Monastery goes way back to the time period
          between 1928 to 1948. Currently, the Adisham Monastery is owned by the
          Benedictine Monks and it is opened for the public only on the
          weekends, public and school holidays. The scenic beauty will make you
          fall in love with the beautiful monastery surrounded by the flower
          beds and the orchards with a variety of fruits and vegetables. Towards
          the side of the monastery is a thick dense forest with a bird
          sanctuary called Thangamale Sanctuary. The Bungalow will be opened
          from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm. However, to embrace the beauty of the
          monastery and the weather, its better you visit the place early in the
          morning. Sir Thomas Lister Villiers an English planter came to Sri
          Lanka in a ship that transport Tea in 1827. As a young lad, he was
          working at the George Stuarts Tea Industry when he commenced building
          the Adisham bungalow in 1931. Once Sir Thomas Lister Villiers retired
          from service the ownership of the Adisham Bungalow was taken over by
          the Sedawatte mills in 1951. Again in 1961 Roman Catholic Church
          purchased the bungalow in 1961 which converted the Bungalow into a
          Monastery. There are many Orchards around the Adisham Monastery
          maintained by the Benedictine Monks. With the helping hand of the
          villages around the monastery the monks have cultivated Oranges,
          Guavas, Strawberries and Vegetables.
